<h3>Project Motivation</h3>
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I am choosing IMDB data set to better understand about user and critics rating .
I would like to address following questions

1.Do Movies that are well rated by public and critics make the most money ?

2. Which are Highest Movie rated by critics ?

3. which is The most popular movie of all time rated by audience ?

4. Film Rating vs Run time ?

<h3>File Description</h3>
