Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose FIFA 19 complete player dataset.

As a football fan, it would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here.

My key interests would be:

What's the ratio of total wages/ total potential for clubs. Which clubs are the most economical ？
How is nation team player total market value distributed? Probably show a distribution plot in a world map?
How is a player's skilsl set influence his potential/wage? Can we predict a player's potential based on his skills' set?
File Descriptions
Data.csv contains lastest edition FIFA 2019 players attributes including age, potential, wage, etc.

There is also a notebook available here to showcsae all my work related to my three questions.

Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available
